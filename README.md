Food and Vegetable Prescription Program

This application allows dietitians to generate a "Green Bucks" prescription via QR code for patients with food insecurity. Green bucks are redeemable at select farmers markets in NYC allowing the patient to purchase fresh fruits and vegetables.

The application runs on a Node web server back-end and a React front-end.
